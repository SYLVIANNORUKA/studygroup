## Brief Description

EIP-1559 introduces a new transaction pricing mechanism aimed at improving the user experience and efficiency of the Ethereum network's fee market. Prior to this proposal, Ethereum's transaction fees were determined by a first-price auction model, leading to inefficiencies and unpredictable fees. EIP-1559 replaces this with a base fee that adjusts dynamically based on network congestion, along with a priority fee (tip) that users can include to incentivize miners. A significant aspect of this proposal is that the base fee is burned, reducing the overall supply of ETH and potentially impacting its economic model.​
